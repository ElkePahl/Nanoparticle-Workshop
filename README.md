**Nanocamp Nanoparticle Workshop**

This repository contains a Python notebook to be used for the nanocamp 2024 workshop on "Computational Design of Nanoparticles"

**How to use the notebook**

Python notebooks allow a nice combination of 
- *text cells* for guidance through the notebooks and explanantions
- *code cells* that allows to develop Python code and run it 

We will use the notebook to get a first insight into the wonderful world of nanoparticles.

To begin you will 
- download the notebook
- open google colab (make an account with a gmail address)
- open the notebook in google colab

Have fun!
